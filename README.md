# TDMNN
These are the main codes of EEG-based emotion recognition using a temporal-difference minimizing neural network (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11571-023-10004-w). The preprocessing of datasets is similar to that of 4D-CRNN. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at liming78@nudt.edu.cn.
